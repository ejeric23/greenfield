On the Bus I was the person woman with about sixty Italian fishermen and I’ve never met sixty such charming gentlemen—they were wonderful. Some company was sending them downstate where their boats and (they hoped) fish were waiting for them. Some could hardly speak english not only do I love Greeks [illegible] I love Italians. they’re warm, lusty and friendly as hell—I’d love to go to Italy someday.",

Oh Pleez GAWD I can’t handle the success! The success! And i feel so incredibly guilty! For abandoning mytrue commrades who were the ones who are devoted who were into us a few years ago.

    "post": "We walked over to have lunch at One Fifth, and on the way we saw Patti Smith in a bowler hat buying food for her cat. I invited her thinking she’d say no, but she said, “Great.” When we walked in, there was the number-one bestseller Fran Lebowitz sitting with Lisa Robinson. One Fifth is pretty–bright and chintzy.\n\nPatti didn’t want to eat too much, so she ate half my lunch. She said she only loves blonds and that she wanted to have an affair with a blond. All I could think about was her b.o.–she wouldn’t be bad-looking if she would wash up and glue herself together a little better. She’s still skinny. She’s with a gallery now, doing drawings and writing poetry. The Robert Miller Gallery.",
